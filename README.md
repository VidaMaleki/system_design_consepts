# System Design Concepts

Welcome to my **System Design Concepts** repository!  
This repo is part of my journey to **master backend architecture and system design**, especially for technical interviews and real-world applications.

## Goal

To deeply understand how scalable systems are designed, covering both theoretical foundations and practical examples.  
I aim to complete **one system design topic each week**, including writing explanations and solving a relevant design problem.

---

## 📚 Weekly Topics

### Basics & Foundations
1. **What is System Design?**
2. **Scalability: Vertical vs Horizontal**
3. **Latency vs Throughput**
4. **Load Balancing**
5. **Caching**
6. **Database Design**
   - SQL vs NoSQL
   - Sharding, Replication, and CAP Theorem
7. **Consistency Models**
   - Strong vs Eventual Consistency
   - ACID vs BASE

### Core Components
8. **API Gateway & Microservices**
9. **Message Queues (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ)**
10. **Rate Limiting & Throttling**
11. **CDNs (Content Delivery Networks)**
12. **Authentication & Authorization**
13. **Logging, Monitoring, and Observability**
14. **Data Partitioning and Indexing**

### Practical System Design Problems
Each problem will include:
- Requirements gathering
- High-level architecture diagram
- Component breakdown
- Scalability & trade-offs
- Bottlenecks and how to resolve them
